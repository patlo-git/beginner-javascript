    // For
    // good for running code an X number of times.
    // requires three things; initial expression, condition, final expression
    // flexible in incrementing in the ways that we want
    // traditionally used to loop over something, like an array of numbers 
    for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    }

    // For of
    // fairly new to JS. 
    // used for looping over iterables; something with a length.
    // good for using with emojis
    // if you ever need to sequence a bunch of data, doing one thing after another in a loop, the for of loop will allow you to use await inside of it.
    // use case - sequencing promises
    for(const letter of name) {
      console.log(letter);
    }

    for(const number of numbers) {
      console.log(number);
    }

    // downside to this vs for each is that it doesn't give us the index, just gives us the raw value. also can't filter.

    // For in 
    // used to looping over keys of an object
    // works similarly to for of
    // "how is this better than object.entries or object.keys or object.values?" it's not, that is preferred.
    // gotcha. vs object.entries. looks ahead to prototypes.
    // if you need to grab the prototype methods and properties you can use a for in loop to grab those.
    for(const prop in wes) {
      console.log(prop);
    }

    // While Loop
    // and Do While don't use very often
    // The while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement.
    // takes a condition and runs infinitely until returns false
    // need an exit condition or will run in infinite loop
    // always checks the condition before the first run then goes ahead and does it.
    let cool = true;
    let i = 1;
    while(cool === true) {
      console.log('You are cool');
      i++;
      if (i > 100) {
        cool = false;
      }
    }

    // Do While Loop
    // we have a do that runs first, then checks the condition after the first run
    // creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to false. 
    do {
