    // when you mark a function as async it will immediately return a Promise to you
    // when it's not marked async it's a reg function that will return the data you want
    // so you can await async functions b/c they are Promises themselves.

    // ASYNC FUNCTIONS will always return a PROMISE themselves
    // which means we can use a .catch or .then syntax on async functions if we want

    // Useful: often you have a function that does a few things with promises inside of it
    // but then you want to wait for the entire function to finish returning it's data
    // if that's the case then you can await or use a .catch or .then on it

    // can nest promises as deep as you want
